This is a repository for learning Web3

Web 3 refers to a paradigm shift in the design, infrastructure, and philosophy of the internet, aiming to establish a decentralized, user-centric, and trustless digital ecosystem.

Aim: Implement and deploy a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. Upon user interaction and the transfer of ETH, trigger an event to a centralized server and automatically generate a Google Meets meeting connecting both parties.

### BTC
- Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized digital ledger technology used to record and verify transactions across multiple computers
- Network of computers that communicate and secure a netwokr
- Addressing from BTC address to how much bitcoin is owned
- Only does one type of financial trasnaction for one currency which is BTC

### Ethereum
- "ETH" refers to Ethereum, which is a decentralized platform and blockchain that goes beyond simply being a digital currency like Bitcoin (BTC).
- Ethereum's primary feature is its ability to support and execute "smart contracts," which are self-executing code that can automatically perform specific actions when certain conditions are met
- Progammers can deploy code as smart contracts on one or multiple machine
- A decentralized exchange (DEX) smart contract is a type of self-executing code deployed on a blockchain platform, typically Ethereum, that enables the trading of cryptocurrencies and other digital assets directly between users without the need for an intermediary

### Solidity 
- Solidity is a high-level contratc centric language specifically designed for writing smart contracts on blockchain platforms, most notably on the Ethereum blockchain.
